#### Setting Up a Docker Hub Repository

{{% notice note %}}
In this section, I’ve pre-configured images on Docker Hub. If you’re not yet familiar with pushing images to Docker Hub, refer to the [Deploy Application on Docker Container](https://000015.awsstudygroup.com/) guide. It provides a step-by-step tutorial to help you grasp the essential process and requirements.

- In the **frontend** repository, I’ve prepared images that have been pushed with version tags.

- In the **backend** repository, images have also been prepared and pushed with version tags.
